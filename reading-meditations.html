        <h1>Meditations</h1>
        <h2>Marcus Aurelius</h2>
      </div>

    <p>
      Meditations is a collection of private reflections written by one of the most powerful men in history, the Emperor of Rome. Throughout these entries, Marcus Aurelius returns to several core themes, including the importance of controlling one’s emotions, resisting the desire for fame and external praise, and accepting death as an unavoidable part of life.
    </p>

    <p>
      The theme that resonated most with me is his belief that many of our problems are created in the mind. Events themselves are rarely the true source of our suffering; rather, it is our interpretation of those events that gives them power over us.
    </p>

    <p>
      Aurelius reminds the reader that anxiety often comes from projecting ourselves into the future. He advises that we meet future challenges with the same reason and clarity we use to handle the present moment, trusting that we will be equipped when the time comes.
