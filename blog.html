      <h1 class="post-title">The Key to New Year’s: Consistency</h1>
      <div class="post-date">January 2026</div>

      <div class="post-content">
        <p>
          For my first blog, I want to talk about some of my New Year’s resolutions,
          especially given that it’s the beginning of 2026.
        </p>

        <p>
          I’ve fallen victim many times, as I’m sure many of you have, to coming up
          with ambitious goals for the new year and then falling short within just
          a few weeks. Why does this happen to everyone? That initial wave of
          excitement and determination suddenly seems to fade away by the third or
          fourth week.
        </p>

        <p>
          This year, one of my main goals was to be more consistent in the gym. So
          far, I’d say I’m off to a great start. I’ve had to make some adjustments
          with my new job, since I start work at 7:00 a.m. every morning.
        </p>

        <p>
          I wake up at 4:45 a.m. and try to get to the gym around 5:00. It’s a
          sacrifice I’m more than happy to make, especially considering that the
          gym after work is a madhouse. In the mornings, it’s quiet, less busy, and
          you see the same 10 to 15 people every time.
        </p>

        <p>
          Working out, for me, is a way to release stress, and there’s no better
          feeling than leaving the gym after a great workout. It’s the perfect way
          for me to start my day. That sense of accomplishment is something I can
          build on as the day goes on, a lesson I picked up from reading
          <em>Make Your Bed</em>.
        </p>

        <p>
          I think, like most things, the key is consistency. You won’t see results
          after a week, or even after a month, but when you finally start to notice
          some differences, it makes you want to work even harder. Maybe that’s why
          people don’t last more than a few weeks with their goals. They aren’t
          willing to stay consistent, and they’re impatient.
        </p>

        <p>
          I like to think of someone cutting down a tree with a saw. A few strokes
          won’t make much of an impact. Not even fifty strokes. But if you stay
          consistent, you will eventually achieve that goal.
