        <h1>Make Your Bed</h1>
        <h2>William H. McRaven</h2>
      </div>
    </div>

    <p>
      In this book, Admiral McRaven does an excellent job translating his experiences in the Navy into simple lessons that can genuinely improve everyday life. The most basic, yet arguably most important lesson he shares is the habit of making your bed each morning.
    </p>

    <p>
      By completing this small task at the start of the day, you create an early sense of accomplishment. That initial win sets a positive tone and can carry forward into other tasks, reinforcing discipline and momentum as the day unfolds.
    </p>

    <p>
      I have always appreciated things being clean and orderly, and this book reinforced the value of that mindset. Even on rushed mornings, taking the time to make the bed is a reminder that small, consistent actions matter. No matter how difficult the day becomes, coming home to a made bed provides a sense of comfort and closure.
