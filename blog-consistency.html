    <h1>The Key to New Year’s: Consistency</h1>
    <div class="date">January 2026</div>

    <div class="content">
      <p>For my first blog, I’m going to talk about some of my New Year’s resolutions, given it’s the beginning of 2026.</p>

      <p>I have fallen victim many times as I’m sure many of you have to coming up with ambitious goals for the new year and falling short within a few weeks. Why does this happen to everyone? That wave of excitement and determination suddenly seems to fade away by the third or fourth week.</p>

      <p>This year, one of my main goals was to be more consistent in the gym. So far, I’d say I’m off to a great start to this goal. I’ve had to make some adjustments with my new job, as I start work at 7am every morning.</p>

      <p>I wake up at 4:45 am and try to get to the gym around 5:00. It’s a sacrifice I’m more than happy to make given the gym after work is a mad house. In the morning it’s quiet, less busy, and you see the same 10 to 15 people every time.</p>

      <p>Working out for me is a way to release stress, and there’s no better feeling then leaving the gym after a great workout. For me it’s the perfect way to start my day. A sense of accomplishment that I can build on as the day goes on, a lesson I learned from reading the book Make your bed.</p>

      <p>I think like most things the key is consistency. You won’t see results after a week or even a month, but when you do finally start to notice some differences, it makes you want to work even harder. Maybe that’s why people don’t last more than a few weeks with their goals, they aren’t willing to be consistent and are impatient.</p>

      <p>I like to think of someone cutting a tree with a saw. A few strokes of the saw won’t make much impact. Not even 50 strokes. But if you are consistent, you will eventually achieve that goal.</p>
